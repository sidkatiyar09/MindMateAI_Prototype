MindMate.AI — Executable Prototype (Streamlit + FastAPI scaffold)

What's inside:
- app.py                 : Streamlit app (UI demo)
- notebook_gen.py        : generates starter Jupyter notebooks from local logs
- api_app.py             : FastAPI scaffold for uploading CSVs & generating notebooks
- data/sample_student_stress.csv : sample CSV logs
- data/ (folder)         : will hold mood_logs.csv generated by app
- requirements.txt       : Python dependencies
- run_demo.bat           : Windows batch script to launch the prototype
- run_demo.sh            : Unix shell script to launch the prototype

How to run (Windows):
1. Install Python 3.8+ and create a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Streamlit UI (recommended for demo):
   streamlit run app.py

4. Optionally, run the API server:
   uvicorn api_app:app --reload --port 8000

Notes:
- The prototype is intentionally lightweight and uses a simple lexicon-based sentiment analyzer.
- Red-flag phrases trigger a safety alert message and are handled locally.
- For improved NLP, integrate Hugging Face transformers or OpenAI APIs (requires credentials).
- This prototype stores logs locally in data/mood_logs.csv (no cloud storage).


Added dataset: data/student_records_100.csv — 100 synthetic student records for demo and testing.
